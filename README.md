# Landing Page

React project using Typescript and styled-components, developed during Campinas Tech Talents bootcamp.
The idea was to clone a given interface and test all of the components created.

This project uses <a href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook</a> to document components and their props, an useful way to reuse and virtually test them. To check this out run Storybook following the directions below and access <a href="http://localhost:6006/">http://localhost:6006/</a>.
